# CamBench - Cryptographic API Misuse Detection Tool Benchmark

![](./logos/CamBench.png)

CamBench envision to be a comprehensive benchmark for cryptographic API misuse detection tools consisting of three components: 
- CamBench_Real includes real-world Java applications with manually labelled usages. 
- CamBench_Cap includes synthetic test-cases to cover analysis capabilities.
- CamBench_Cov is an heuristic for crypto API coverage. 

CamBench is accepted as [registered report at MSR 22](https://conf.researchr.org/track/msr-2022/msr-2022-registered-reports?#event-overview) [^1].
