name:
  Broken Crypto Path- And Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  A variable is assigned with the name of the insecure DES cipher. The variable is then re-assigned with
  an instance of the Blowfish cipher in the reachable branch of the conditional statement instead of the unreachable 
  branch with AES, before the cipher is initialized.

    A cipher object is initialized based on the Blowfish algorithm, which should not be utilized as it is considered
    to be broken.
