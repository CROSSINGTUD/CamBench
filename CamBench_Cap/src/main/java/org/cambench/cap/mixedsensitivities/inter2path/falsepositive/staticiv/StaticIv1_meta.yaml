  Static Initialization Vector 2-Interprocedural Path-Sensitive False-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  The byte array for the iv initialization is set to a securely random value in the reachable branch of the conditional 
  statement.
  The byte array is then passed to a method where it is used to create an initialization vector.
  In the other branch, which is never reached, the byte array is filled with static values.
