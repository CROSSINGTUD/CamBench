name:
  Broken Hash Function Field- & Flow-Sensitive False-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  The names two insecure hash algorithms (MD5 and SHA-1) are stored in an object's fields. The field containing the 
  SHA-1 value is then sanitized by re-assigning it with a secure algorithm before being used to
  get an instance of the SHA-256 algorithm.
