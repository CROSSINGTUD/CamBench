  Small Key Size Path- And Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  Two objects are created that each contain an integer that defines a keySize (1024 and 2048). The object with
  the key size of 1024 is then used in the reachable branch of the conditional statement to 
  create a keyPair for the initialization of the RSA algorithm.

fix:
  description:
    Increase the key size to the recommended value of 2048 bits or more for the RSA algorithm.

  issue-description:
    The size of the generated keys does not conform the recommended minimum of 2048 bits.
    Smaller key sizes can lead to insecurities when using the RSA algorithm.
