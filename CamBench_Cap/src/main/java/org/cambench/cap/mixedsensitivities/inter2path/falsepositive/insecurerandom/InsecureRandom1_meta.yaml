  Insecure Random 2-Interprocedural Path-Sensitive False-Positive Case 1

description:
  The byte array used for the creation of an initialization vector is filled with random values in a secure way 
  in the reachable branch of the conditional statement by using the SecureRandom class. 
  The other branch, which is not reached, uses the standard Random class to fill the byte array in an insecure way.
  The array is then passed to a method where it is used to create an initialization vector.
