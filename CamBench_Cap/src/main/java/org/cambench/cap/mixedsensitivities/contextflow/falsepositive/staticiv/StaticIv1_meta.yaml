  Static Initialization Vector Context- & Flow-Sensitive False-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  A static, string based byte array and a securely random byte array are stored in variables by using the identity function.
  The securely random iv is then used to create an initialization vector for the initialization
  of an instance of the AES cipher, before the variable is re-assigned with a static byte array.
