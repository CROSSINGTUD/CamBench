name:
  Broken Crypto Path- And Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 2

api:
  javax.crypto.KeyGenerator

description:
  Two objects are created in each branch of the conditional statement that each have a string with 
  the name of a cryptographic cipher as value (Blowfish and AES, respectively). 
  The object containing the Blowfish string is then used to get an instance of the KeyGenerator.

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure algorithm with a secure one (e.g. AES, depending on the algorithm used for the cipher object).

  issue-description:
    The KeyGenerator is initialized with an insecure algorithm. Since insecure algorithms should not be utilized
    to create cipher objects, they also should not be utilized to create the according keys.
