name:
  Broken Crypto Path- And Context-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  The algo variables are set to the names of an insecure (DES) and a secure cipher (AES) by using the
  Identity function.
  Then the variable with the DES algorithm is used in the reachable branch of the 
  conditional statement to get an instance of the cipher.

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).

    A cipher object is initialized based on the DES algorithm, which should not be utilized as it is considered
    to be broken.
