name:
  Broken Hash Function Path- And Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 2

api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  Two objects are created in each branch of the conditional statement that each contain a string with the name
  of a hash algorithm as value (SHA-1 and SHA-256, respectively). The object with the SHA-256 string is then
  used to create an instance of the algorithm.

crypto-usage:
  violation: true

  issue-description:
    SHA-1 is a broken hash algorithm and should therefore not be used for its cryptographic properties.
