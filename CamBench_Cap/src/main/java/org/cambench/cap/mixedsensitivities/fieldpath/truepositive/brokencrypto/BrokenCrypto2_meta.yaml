name:
  Broken Crypto Path- And Field-Sensitive True-Positive Case 2

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  The names of a secure (AES) & an insecure cipher (Blowfish) are stored in an object's fields, 
  depending on the conditional statement. 
  An insecure one is then used to get an instance of the cipher.

  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).

    A cipher object is initialized based on the Blowfish algorithm, which should not be utilized as it is considered
    to be broken.
