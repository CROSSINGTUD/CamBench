name:
  Broken Hash Function Flow- & Object-Sensitive True-Negative Case 2

api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  Two objects are created that each contain a string that is set to the name of a an insecure hash algorithm
  (SHA-1). One of these strings is then re-assigned with the name of a secure
  hash algorithm and used to create an instance of the algorithm and calculate the hash value of some data.
