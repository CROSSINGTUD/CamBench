  ECB Mode 2-Interprocedural Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  A configuration for the AES algorithm containing the ECB mode of operation is passed to method where a cipher
  object is initialized with this configuration before the original configuration is overwritten with a more secure 
  configuration.

fix:
  description:
    Do not utilize the ECB mode of operation. Instead, use a more secure mode, like GCM.

  issue-description:
    Block ciphers should not be used with the ECB mode of operation. ECB mode is considered to be insecure since
    identical blocks of plaintext will be encrypted to identical blocks of ciphertext.
