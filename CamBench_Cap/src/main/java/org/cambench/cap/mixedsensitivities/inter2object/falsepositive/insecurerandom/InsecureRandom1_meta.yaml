api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two objects are created that each contain a random generator (one of Class Random, one of class SecureRandom).
  The SecureRandom object passed to a method to fill a byte array with random values, which is then used to create an
  initialization vector for cipher initialization.
