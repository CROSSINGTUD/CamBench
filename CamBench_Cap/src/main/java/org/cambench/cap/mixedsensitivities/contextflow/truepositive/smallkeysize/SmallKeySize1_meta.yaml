name:
  Small Key Size Context- & Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  Two different key sizes (1024 and 2048) are stored in variables using the identity function.
  The smaller key size is then used to initialize the instance of the RSA algorithm for encryption, before it is
  re-assigned with bigger, secure key size.

  issue-description:
    The key-pair that is used for the RSA algorithm is initialized with a too small size (1024 bits).
    As recommended by NIST, RSA keys should be at least of 2048 bits.
