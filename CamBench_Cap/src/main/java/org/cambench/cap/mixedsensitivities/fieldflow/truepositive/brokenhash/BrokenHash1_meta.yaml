name:
  Broken Hash Function Field- & Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  The names two insecure hash algorithms (MD5 and SHA-1) are stored in an object's fields. The field containing the 
  SHA-1 value is then sanitized by re-assigning it with a secure algorithm before the other field is used to
  get an instance of the MD5 algorithm.

  violation: true

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure hash algorithm with a secure hash algorithm (e.g. SHA-256).

  issue-description:
    MD5 is a broken hash algorithm and should therefore not be used for its cryptographic properties.
