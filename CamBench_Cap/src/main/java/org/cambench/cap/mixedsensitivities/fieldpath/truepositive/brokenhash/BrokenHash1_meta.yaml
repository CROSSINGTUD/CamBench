name:
  Broken Hash Function Path- And Field-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  The names of a secure & an insecure hash algorithm (MD5) are stored in an object's fields. TThe insecure one is then
  used in the reachable branch of the conditional statement to get an instance of the hash algorithm.

crypto-usage:
  violation: true

  description:
    Replace the insecure hash algorithm with a secure hash algorithm (e.g. SHA-256).

  issue-description:
    MD5 is a broken hash algorithm and should therefore not be used for its cryptographic properties.
