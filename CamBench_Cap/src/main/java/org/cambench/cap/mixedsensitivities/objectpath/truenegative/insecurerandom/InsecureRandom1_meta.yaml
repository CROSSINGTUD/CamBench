  Insecure Random Path- And Object-Sensitive True-Negative Case 1

api:
  - javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two objects are created in each branch of the conditional statement that each contain one object of a Random generator.
  The first one contains an object of the Random class, the second one contains an object of the SecureRandom class. 
  The object containing the SecureRandom generator is then used to create an initialization vector for a cipher.
