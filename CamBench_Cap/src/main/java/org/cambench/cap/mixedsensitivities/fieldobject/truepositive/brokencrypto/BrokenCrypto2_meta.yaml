name:
  Broken Crypto Field- & Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 2

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  The names of a secure & an insecure cipher (DES) are each stored in the fields of two objects.
  One of the fields containing an insecure cipher is then used to initialize the actual cipher object.

  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).

  issue-description:
    A cipher object is initialized based on the DES algorithm, which should not be utilized as it is considered
    to be broken.
