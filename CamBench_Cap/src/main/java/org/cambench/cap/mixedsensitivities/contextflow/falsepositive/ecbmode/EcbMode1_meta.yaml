name:
  ECB Mode Context- & Flow-Sensitive False-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two configurations of the AES algorithm (one with ECB and one with CBC mode of operation) are stored in variables
  by using the identity function.
  The secure CBC configuration is then used to initialize a cipher object for encryption before the variable
  containing it is re-assigned with an insecure configuration.
