  Broken Hash Function Context- & Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  Two objects that each contain a string with a the name of a hash algorithm
  as value (MD5 and SHA-256, respectively) are created by calling the GetObject method. 
  The object with the MD5 string is then used to create an instance of the algorithm.

  issue-description:
    MD5 is a broken hash algorithm and should therefore not be used for its cryptographic properties.
