name:
  ECB Mode Context- & Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two objects are created by using the GetObject method. Each object stores a string with a configuration of the AES 
  algorithm (one with ECB mode, the other with CBC mode). 
  The object with the ECB configuration is then used to initialize a cipher object.

fix:
  description:
    Do not utilize the ECB mode of operation. Instead, use a more secure mode, such as CBC.

  issue-description:
    Block ciphers should not be used with the ECB mode of operation. ECB mode is considered to be insecure since
    identical blocks of plaintext will be encrypted to identical blocks of ciphertext.
