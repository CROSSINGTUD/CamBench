  Insecure Random Context- & Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  Two objects are created by using the GetObject method. Each object holds an instance of a Random generator. 
  The first one contains an object of the Random class, the second one contains an object of the SecureRandom class. 
  The object containing the (insecure) Random generator is then used to create an initialization vector for a cipher.

  description:
    Replace the used object of the "Random" class with an object of the "SecureRandom" class
    to generate a byte array for an iv.

  issue-description:
    The "Random" class is used to generate a random byte array, which can lead to insecurities.
    For cryptographic use cases, the "SecureRandom" class should be used.
