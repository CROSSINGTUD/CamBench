name:
  Static Initialization Vector Path- And Field-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  A static and a random, non-static initialization vector (iv) are stored in an object's fields, 
  depending on the conditional statement.
  The static iv is then utilized to initialize an instance of the AES algorithm.

fix:
  description:
    Use the SecureRandom class to create a pseudorandom byte array instead of using a static value for iv creation.

  issue-description:
    A static value is used to create an initialization vector. This can lead to insecurities, since initialization
    vectors are often required to be random in order to guarantee a secure encryption.
