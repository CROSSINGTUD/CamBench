name:
  Static Initialization Vector Path- And Context-Sensitive False-Positive Case 2

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  A static and a random, non-static byte array are created with the identity function and stored as
  variables, depending on the conditional statement.
  The random, non-static array is then used as initialization vector to initialize an instance of the AES algorithm.
