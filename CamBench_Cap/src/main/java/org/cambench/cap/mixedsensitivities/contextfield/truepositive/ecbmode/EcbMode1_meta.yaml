name:
  ECB Mode Context- & Field-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two configurations of the AES algorithm are stored in an object's fields by using the Identity function. 
  One contains the insecure ECB mode of operation, the other the secure GCM mode. 
  The ECB configuration is then used to initialize an instance of the AES cipher.

fix:
  description:
    Do not utilize the ECB mode of operation. Instead, use a more secure mode, such as GCM.

  issue-description:
    Block ciphers should not be used with the ECB mode of operation. ECB mode is considered to be insecure since
    identical blocks of plaintext will be encrypted to identical blocks of ciphertext.
