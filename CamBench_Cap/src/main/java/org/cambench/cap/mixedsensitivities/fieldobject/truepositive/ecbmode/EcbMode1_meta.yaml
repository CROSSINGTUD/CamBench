name:
  ECB Mode Filed- & Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two configurations of the AES algorithm are each stored in the fields of two objects. 
  One contains the secure CBC mode of operation, the other the insecure ECB mode. 
  One of the fields containing an insecure configuration is then used to initialize a cipher object.

fix:
  description:
    Do not utilize the ECB mode of operation. Instead, use a more secure mode, like CBC.

  issue-description:
    Block ciphers should not be used with the ECB mode of operation. ECB mode is considered to be insecure since
    identical blocks of plaintext will be encrypted to identical blocks of ciphertext.
