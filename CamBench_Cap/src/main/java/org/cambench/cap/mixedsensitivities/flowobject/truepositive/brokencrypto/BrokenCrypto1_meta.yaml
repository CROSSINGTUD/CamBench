name:
  Broken Crypto Flow- & Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two objects are created that each have a field that is set to the name of a cipher (DES, AES).
  These fields are then re-assigned with the name of a secure or insecure cipher configuration and an insecure algorithm
  is used to create an instance of the cipher.

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).

  issue-description:
    A cipher object is initialized based on the DES algorithm, which should not be utilized as it is considered
    to be broken.
