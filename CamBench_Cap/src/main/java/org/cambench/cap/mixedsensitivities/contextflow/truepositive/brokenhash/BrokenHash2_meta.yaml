name:
  Broken Hash Function Context- & Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 2

api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  The names of a broken hash algorithm (SHA-1) and a secure one (SHA-256) are stored in variables using the identity function.
  The variable containing the insecure algorithm is used to compute a hash value before the variable is re-assigned
  with the name of a secure algorithm.

  issue-description:
    The hash algorithm SHA-1 is considered broken and should therefore not be used to compute hash values.
