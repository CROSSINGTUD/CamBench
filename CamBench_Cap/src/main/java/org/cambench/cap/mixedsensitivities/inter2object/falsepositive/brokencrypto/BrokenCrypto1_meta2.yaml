  Broken Crypto 2-Interprocedural Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.KeyGenerator

description:
  Two objects are created that each hold the name of a single cipher. One contains the insecure DES cipher, the other
  the secure AES cipher. The object with the insecure cipher is then passed to a method and 
  used to get an instance of the KeyGenerator.

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure algorithm with a secure one (e.g. AES, depending on the algorithm used for the cipher object).

  issue-description:
    The KeyGenerator is initialized with an insecure algorithm. Since insecure algorithms should not be utilized
    to create cipher objects, they also should not be utilized to create the according keys.
