  Insecure Random 2-Interprocedural Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  A byte array is filled with values by using the SecureRandom class before the values are overwritten by using the 
  standard Random class. The array is then passed to a method where it is used to create an 
  initialization vector for cipher initialization.

    Replace the used object of the "Random" class with an object of the "SecureRandom" class
    to generate a byte array for an iv.

  issue-description:
    The "Random" class is used to generate a random byte array, which can lead to insecurities.
    For cryptographic use cases, the "SecureRandom" class should be used.
