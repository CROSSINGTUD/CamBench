name:
  Broken Crypto Field- & Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.KeyGenerator

description:
  The names of two insecure ciphers (Blowfish and DES) are stored in an object's fields. 
  The field containing the Blowfish value is then sanitized by re-assigning it with the name of a secure
  algorithm (AES) before the other field is used to get an instance of the KeyGenerator.

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure algorithm with a secure one (e.g. AES, depending on the algorithm used for the cipher object).

  issue-description:
    The KeyGenerator is initialized with an insecure algorithm. Since insecure algorithms should not be utilized
    to create cipher objects, they also should not be utilized to create the according keys.
