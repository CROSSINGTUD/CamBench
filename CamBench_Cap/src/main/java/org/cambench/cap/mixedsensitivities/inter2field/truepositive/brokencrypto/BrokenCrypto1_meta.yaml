  Broken Crypto 2-Interprocedural Field-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  The names of a secure (AES) & an insecure cipher (Blowfish) are stored in an object's fields. The insecure one is then 
  passed to a method and used to initialize the actual cipher object.

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).

  issue-description:
    A cipher object is initialized based on the Blowfish algorithm, which should not be utilized since there exist
    attacks on 64-bit block ciphers like sweet32.
