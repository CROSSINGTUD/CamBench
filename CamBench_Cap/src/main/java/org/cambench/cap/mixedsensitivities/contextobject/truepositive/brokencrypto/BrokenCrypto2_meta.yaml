name:
  Broken Crypto Context- & Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 2

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two objects that each have a string with a the name of a cryptographic cipher
  as value (DES and AES, respectively) are created by calling the GetObject method. 
  The object with the DES string is then used to create an instance of the cipher.

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).

    A cipher object is initialized based on the DES algorithm, which should not be utilized as it is considered
    to be broken.
