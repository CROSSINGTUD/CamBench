  Small Key Size 2-Interprocedural Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  A variable containing a small key size (1024 bits) is passed as argument to a method and used 
  to generate a KeyPair for the RSA algorithm, before the variable is set to an appropriate key size (2048 bits).

  issue-description:
    The size of the generated keys does not conform the recommended minimum of 2048 bits.
    Smaller key sizes can lead to insecurities when using the RSA algorithm.
