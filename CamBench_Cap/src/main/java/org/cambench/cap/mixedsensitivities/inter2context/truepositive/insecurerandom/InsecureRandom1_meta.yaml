  Insecure Random 2-Interprocedural Context-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  An instance of the Random class and one of the SecureRandom class are created by using the Identity function.
  The first one is then used to create a byte array with random values
  which is then passed to a method and used to create an initialization vector.

  description:
    Instead of the standard Random class, use the SecureRandom class to generate in initialization vector.

    The initialization vector (iv) that is used to initialize an instance of a cipher is created with the standard 
    Random class, which should not be used in a cryptographic context.
