description:
  Two objects are created by using the GetObject method. Each object holds an instance of a Random generator. 
  The first one contains an object of the Random class, the second one contains an object of the SecureRandom class. 
  The object containing the SecureRandom object is then used to create an initialization vector for a cipher.
