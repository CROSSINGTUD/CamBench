  Insecure Random Flow- & Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  Two objects are created that each contain an instance of class Random or SecureRandom. These instances are replaced,
  however, an instance of class Random is used to fill a byte array with random values which is utilized as
  initialization vector for a cipher.

    Replace the used object of the "Random" class with an object of the "SecureRandom" class
    to generate a byte array for an iv.

    The "Random" class is used to generate a random byte array, which can lead to insecurities.
    For cryptographic use cases, the "SecureRandom" class should be used.
