name:
  Broken Crypto 2-Interprocedural Context-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  The algo variables are set to an insecure (DES) and a secure cipher (AES), respectively, 
  by using the Identity function.
  The insecure one is then utilized to initialize the cipher object.

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with a proper configuration).

  issue-description:
    A cipher object is initialized based on the DES algorithm, which should not be utilized as it is considered
    to be broken.
