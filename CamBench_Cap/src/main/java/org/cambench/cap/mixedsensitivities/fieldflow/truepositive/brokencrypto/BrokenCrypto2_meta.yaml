name:
  Broken Crypto Field- & Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 2

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  The names of a secure (AES) & an insecure cipher (DES) are stored in an object's fields.
  The insecure one is then used to initialize the actual cipher object before the field containing it is re-assigned
  with the name of a secure cipher.

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).

  issue-description:
    A cipher object is initialized based on the DES algorithm, which should not be utilized as it is considered
    to be broken.
