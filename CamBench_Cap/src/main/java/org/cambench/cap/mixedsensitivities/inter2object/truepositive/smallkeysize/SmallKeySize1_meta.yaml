  Small Key Size 2-Interprocedural Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  Two objects are created each contain an integer defining a key size in bits (1024 and 2048). The smaller
  key size is then passed to a method and used to create a KeyPair for initialization of the RSA algorithm.

  issue-description:
    The size of the generated keys does not conform the recommended minimum of 2048 bits.
    Smaller key sizes can lead to insecurities when using the RSA algorithm.
