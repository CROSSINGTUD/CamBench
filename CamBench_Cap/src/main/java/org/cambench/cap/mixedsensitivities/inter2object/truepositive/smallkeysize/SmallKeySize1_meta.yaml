  Small Key Size 2-Interprocedural Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  Two objects are created each contain an integer defining a key size in bits (1024 and 2048). The smaller
  key size is then passed to a method and used to create a KeyPair for initialization of the RSA algorithm.

  issue-description:
    The size of the generated keys does not conform the recommended minimum of 2048 bits.
    Smaller key sizes can lead to insecurities when using the RSA algorithm.
    Beyond 2023 the minimum key length will be 3072 bits.
