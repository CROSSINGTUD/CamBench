  Small Key Size Flow- & Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  Two objects are created that each contain an integer that defines a key size of 512 or 2048 bit. The integers are 
  re-assigned, however, the key size of 512 bit is used to create a keyPair for the initialization of the RSA algorithm.

fix:
  description:
    Increase the key size to the recommended value of 2048 bits or more for the RSA algorithm.

  issue-description:
    The size of the generated keys does not conform the recommended minimum of 2048 bits.
    Smaller key sizes can lead to insecurities when using the RSA algorithm.
    Beyond 2023 the minimum key length will be 3072 bits.
