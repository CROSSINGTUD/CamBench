  Small Key Size Path- And Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  A variable is set to a keySize of 1024 bits.
  The variable is re-assigned in the reachable branch of the conditional statement with a keySize of 512
  bits, before it is used to generate a KeyPair for the RSA algorithm. The secure value of 2048 is not reachable.

  description:
    Increase the key size to the recommended value of 2048 bits or more for the RSA algorithm.

  issue-description:
    The size of the generated keys does not conform the recommended minimum of 2048 bits.
    Smaller key sizes can lead to insecurities when using the RSA algorithm.
    Beyond 2023 the minimum key length will be 3072 bits.
