name:
  ECB Mode Flow- & Object-Sensitive False-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two objects are created that each store a string with a configuration of the AES algorithm that uses 
  the ECB mode of operation. One of these strings is re-assigned with a configuration that uses the more secure CBC mode
  before it is utilized to initialize a cipher object.
