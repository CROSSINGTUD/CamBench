  Broken Crypto 2-Interprocedural Path-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  A string containing the name of an insecure cipher (Blowfish) is passed to a method and initialized
  and used to create an instance of that cipher in the reachable branch of a conditional statement.
  The other branch, which is never reached, passes the name of a secure cipher (AES) to that method.

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).

  issue-description:
    A cipher object is initialized based on the Blowfish algorithm, which should not be utilized since there exist
    attacks on 64-bit block ciphers like sweet32.
