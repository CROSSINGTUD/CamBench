  Small Key Size 2-Interprocedural Path-Sensitive False-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  A sufficiently large key size (2048 bit) is passed to a method in the reachable branch of the conditional statement,
  where it is used to crate a KeyPair for the RSA algorithm.
  In the other branch of the conditional statement, which is never reached, an insufficiently large key size (1024 bit) 
  is passed to the method.
