  Static Initialization Vector Context- & Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 2

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  Two objects are created by using the GetObject method. Each object stores a byte array. One array is static,
  the other is filled with random values by using the SecureRandom class.
  The object containing the static array is then used to create an initialization vector for cipher initialization.

  violation: true

fix:
  description:
    Use the SecureRandom class to create a pseudorandom byte array instead of using a static value for iv creation.

    A static value is used to create an initialization vector. This can lead to insecurities, since initialization
    vectors are often required to be random in order to guarantee a secure encryption.
