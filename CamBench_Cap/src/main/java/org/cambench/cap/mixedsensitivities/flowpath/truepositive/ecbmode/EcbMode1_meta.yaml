name:
  ECB Mode Path- And Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.Cipher

description:
  A variable is set to a configuration of the AES cipher with the insecure ECB mode used. 
  The variable is then re-assigned, however, the secure configuration of the AES cipher that uses the secure CBC mode is
  unreachable. Therefore, the cipher is initialized with ECB mode.

fix:
  description:
    Do not utilize the ECB mode of operation. Instead, use a more secure mode, such as CBC.

  issue-description:
    Block ciphers should not be used with the ECB mode of operation. ECB mode is considered to be insecure since
    identical blocks of plaintext will be encrypted to identical blocks of ciphertext.
