  Small Key Size Field- & Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  Two different key sizes (512 and 1024) are stored in an object's fields. The field containing 1024 is
  then re-assigned with a value of 2048 before the other field is used as key size to create a KeyPait for
  the RSA algorithm.

  violation: true

  issue-description:
    The size of the generated keys does not conform the recommended minimum of 2048 bits.
    Smaller key sizes can lead to insecurities when using the RSA algorithm.
