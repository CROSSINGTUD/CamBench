  Broken Crypto 2-Interprocedural Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.KeyGenerator

description:
  A string containing the name of an insecure cipher (DES) is passed to a method where it is used to get an instance
  of the KeyGenerator, before the string is overwritten with the name of a secure cipher (AES).

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure algorithm with a secure one (e.g. AES, depending on the algorithm used for the cipher object).

  issue-description:
    The KeyGenerator is initialized with an insecure algorithm. Since insecure algorithms should not be utilized
    to create cipher objects, they also should not be utilized to create the according keys.
