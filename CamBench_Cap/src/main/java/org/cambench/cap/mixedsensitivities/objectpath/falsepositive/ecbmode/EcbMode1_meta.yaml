  ECB Mode Path- And Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two objects are created that each store a string with a configuration of the AES algorithm (one with EBC mode, 
  the other with CBC mode). The object with the ECB configuration is then used in the
  reachable branch of the conditional statement to get an instance of a cipher object.

fix:
  description:
    Do not utilize the ECB mode of operation. Instead, use a more secure mode, like CBC.

  issue-description:
    Block ciphers should not be used with the ECB mode of operation. ECB mode is considered to be insecure since
    identical blocks of plaintext will be encrypted to identical blocks of ciphertext.
