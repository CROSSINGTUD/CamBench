  Insecure Random Context- & Field-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec;

description:
  An object of class Random and one of class SecureRandom are created and stored in another object's fields by 
  using the Identity function.
  The instance of the Random class is then utilized to fill a byte array that is used to create
  an initialization vector (iv) for a cipher.

  description:
    Replace the used object of the "Random" class with an object of the "SecureRandom" class
    to generate a byte array for an iv.

    The "Random" class is used to generate a random byte array, which can lead to insecurities.
    For cryptographic use cases, the "SecureRandom" class should be used.
