  Static Initialization Vector Path- And Object-Sensitive True-Negative Case 1

api:
  - javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two objects are created that each store a byte array. One array is based on a static string, 
  the other is filled with random values by using the SecureRandom class. 
  The object containing the random array is then used in the reachable branch of the conditional statement 
  to create an initialization vector for cipher initialization.
