  Broken Crypto 2-Interprocedural Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two objects are created that each hold the name of a single cipher. One contains the insecure DES cipher, the other
  the secure AES cipher. The object with the insecure cipher is then passed to a method and 
  used to initialize a cipher object for encryption.

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).

  issue-description:
    A cipher object is initialized based on the DES algorithm, which should not be utilized as it is considered
    to be broken.
