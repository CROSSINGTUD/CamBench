  Insecure Random 2-Interprocedural Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two objects are created that each contain a random generator (one of Class Random, one of class SecureRandom).
  The Random object passed to a method to fill a byte array with random values, which is then used to create an initialization
  vector for cipher initialization.

  description:
    Replace the used object of the "Random" class with an object of the "SecureRandom" class
    to generate a byte array for an iv.

  issue-description:
    The "Random" class is used to generate a random byte array, which can lead to insecurities.
    For cryptographic use cases, the "SecureRandom" class should be used.
