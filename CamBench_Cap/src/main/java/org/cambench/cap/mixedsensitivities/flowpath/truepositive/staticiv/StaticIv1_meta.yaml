  Static Initialization Vector Path- And Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  A byte array is created and filled with the byte representation of a static string. In the unreachable branch of the
  conditional statement the array would be overwritten with a byte array that was filled with random bytes. However, the
  array is just re-assigned its previous value and used as initialization vector for a cipher.

  description:
    Use the SecureRandom class to create a pseudorandom byte array instead of using a static value for iv creation.

  issue-description:
    A static value is used to create an initialization vector. This can lead to insecurities, since initialization
    vectors are often required to be random in order to guarantee a secure encryption.
