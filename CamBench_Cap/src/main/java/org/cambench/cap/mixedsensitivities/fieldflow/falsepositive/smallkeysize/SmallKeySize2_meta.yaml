name:
  Small Key Size Field- & Flow-Sensitive False-Positive Case 2

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  Two different key sizes (1024 and 2048) are stored in an object's fields. The larger size is then used to
  create a KeyPair and initialize an instance of the RSA algorithm before the field is overwritten with a smaller key size.
