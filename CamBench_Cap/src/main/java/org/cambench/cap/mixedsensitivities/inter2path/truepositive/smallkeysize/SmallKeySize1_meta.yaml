  Small Key Size 2-Interprocedural Path-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  A small key size (1024 bit) is passed to a method in the reachable branch of the conditional statement, where it is used
  to crate a KeyPair for the RSA algorithm.
  In the other branch of the conditional statement, which is never reached, a more secure key size (2048 bit) is passed to the method.

  issue-description:
    The size of the generated keys does not conform the recommended minimum of 2048 bits.
    Smaller key sizes can lead to insecurities when using the RSA algorithm.
    Beyond 2023 the minimum key length will be 3072 bits.
