  Small Key Size 2-Interprocedural Path-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  A small key size (1024 bit) is passed to a method in the reachable branch of the conditional statement, where it is used
  to crate a KeyPair for the RSA algorithm.
  In the other branch of the conditional statement, which is never reached, a more secure key size (2048 bit) is passed to the method.

  issue-description:
    The size of the generated keys does not conform the recommended minimum of 2048 bits.
    Smaller key sizes can lead to insecurities when using the RSA algorithm.
