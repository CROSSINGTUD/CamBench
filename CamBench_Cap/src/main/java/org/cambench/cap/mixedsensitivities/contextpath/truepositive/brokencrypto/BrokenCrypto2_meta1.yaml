name:
  Broken Crypto Path- And Context-Sensitive True-Positive Case 2

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  The names of an insecure (Blowfish) and a secure cipher (AES) are saved into by using the
  Identity function and depending on the branches of the conditional statement.
  Then the variable containing the Blowfish algorithm is used to get an instance of the cipher.

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).

  issue-description:
    A cipher object is initialized based on the Blowfish algorithm, which should not be utilized since there exist
    attacks on 64-bit block ciphers like sweet32.
