  Static Initialization Vector Flow- & Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  Two objects are created that each store a static, string based byte array or a
  random byte array.These arrays are replaced, however, a static value is used to create an initialization vector for
  cipher initialization.

  description:
    Use the SecureRandom class to create a pseudorandom byte array instead of using a static value for iv creation.

  issue-description:
    A static value is used to create an initialization vector. This can lead to insecurities, since initialization
    vectors are often required to be random in order to guarantee a secure encryption.
