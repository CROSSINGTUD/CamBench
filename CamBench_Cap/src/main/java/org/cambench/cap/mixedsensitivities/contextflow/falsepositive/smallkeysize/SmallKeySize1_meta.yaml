name:
  Small Key Size Context- & Flow-Sensitive False-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  Two different key sizes (1024 and 2048) are stored in variables using the identity function.
  The larger key size is then used to initialize the instance of the RSA algorithm for encryption, before it is
  re-assigned with the smaller, insecure key size.
