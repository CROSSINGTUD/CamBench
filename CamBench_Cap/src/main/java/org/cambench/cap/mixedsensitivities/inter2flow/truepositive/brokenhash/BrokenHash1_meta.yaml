  Broken Hash Function 2-Interprocedural Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  A string containing the name of a broken hash algorithm (MD5) is passed as value to another method where 
  a MessageDigest object is initialized to compute the hash value of some data, before the original string is
  overwritten with the name of a secure hash algorithm (SHA-256).

  issue-description:
    MD5 is a broken hash algorithm and should therefore not be used for its cryptographic properties.
