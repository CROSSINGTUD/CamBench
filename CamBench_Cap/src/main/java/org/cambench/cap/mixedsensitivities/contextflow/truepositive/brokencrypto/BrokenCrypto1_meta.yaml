name:
  Broken Crypto Context- & Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  The algo variables are set to the names of an insecure (Blowfish) and a secure cipher (AES) by using the
  identity function.
  The insecure one is then utilized to initialize the cipher object before the variable is re-assigned with the name
  of a secure cipher.

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with a proper configuration).

  issue-description:
    A cipher object is initialized based on the Blowfish algorithm, which should not be utilized since there exist
    attacks on 64-bit block ciphers like sweet32.
