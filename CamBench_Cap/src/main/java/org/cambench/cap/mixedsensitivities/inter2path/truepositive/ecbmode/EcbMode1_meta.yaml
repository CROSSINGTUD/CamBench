  Ecb Mode 2-Interprocedural Path-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.Cipher

description:
  A configuration for the AES cipher using the ECB mode is passed to a method in the reachable branch of a conditional 
  statement, where it is used initialize a cipher object with this configuration.
  The other branch passes a secure configuration (using CBC mode) to the same method, but is never reached.

fix:
  description:
    Replace the ECB mode of operation through another, secure mode, e.g. CBC mode.

  issue-description:
    Block ciphers should not be used with the ECB mode of operation. ECB mode is considered to be insecure since
    identical blocks of plaintext will be encrypted to identical blocks of cyphertext.
