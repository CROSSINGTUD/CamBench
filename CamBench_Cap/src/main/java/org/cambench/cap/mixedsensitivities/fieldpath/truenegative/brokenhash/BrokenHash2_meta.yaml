name:
  Broken Hash Function Path- And Field-Sensitive True-Negative Case 2

api:
  - java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  The names of a secure & an insecure hash algorithm (SHA-1) are stored in an object's fields. TThe secure one is then used
  in the reachable branch of the conditional statement to get an instance of the hash algorithm.
