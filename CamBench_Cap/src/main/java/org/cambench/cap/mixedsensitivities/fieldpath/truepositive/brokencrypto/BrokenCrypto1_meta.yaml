name:
  Broken Crypto Path- And Field-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  The names of a secure (AES) & an insecure cipher (DES) are stored in an object's fields. The insecure one is then used 
  in the reachable branch of the conditional statement to get an instance of the cipher.

  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).

  issue-description:
    A cipher object is initialized based on the DES algorithm, which should not be utilized as it is considered
    to be broken.
