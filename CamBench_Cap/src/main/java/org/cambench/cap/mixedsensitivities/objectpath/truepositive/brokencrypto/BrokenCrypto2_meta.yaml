name:
  Broken Crypto Path- And Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 2

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two objects are created in each branch of the conditional statement that each have a string with 
  the name of a cryptographic cipher as value (DES and AES, respectively). The object containing the DES string is then
  used to create an instance of the cipher.

  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).

  issue-description:
    A cipher object is initialized based on the DES algorithm, which should not be utilized as it is considered
    to be broken.
