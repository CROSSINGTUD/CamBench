  Broken Hash Function 2-Interprocedural Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  A string containing the name of a secure hash algorithm (SHA-256) is
  overwritten with the name of an insecure hash algorithm (SHA-1) and then passed as value to another method where
  a MessageDigest object is initialized to compute the hash value of some data.

  issue-description:
    SHA-1 is a broken hash algorithm and should therefore not be used for its cryptographic properties.
