name:
  Small Key Size Field- & Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 2

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  Two different key sizes (1024 and 2048) are stored in an object's fields. The smaller size is then used to
  create a KeyPair and initialize an instance of the RSA algorithm before the field is overwritten with a bigger key size.

  issue-description:
    The size of the generated keys does not conform the recommended minimum of 2048 bits.
    Smaller key sizes can lead to insecurities when using the RSA algorithm.
