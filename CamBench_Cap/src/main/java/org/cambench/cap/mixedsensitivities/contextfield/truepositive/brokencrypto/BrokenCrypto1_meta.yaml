name:
  Broken Crypto Context- & Field-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  The names of a secure (AES) & an insecure cipher (Blowfish) are stored in an object's fields by using the Identity function.
  The insecure one is then used to initialize the actual cipher object.

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).

    A cipher object is initialized based on the Blowfish algorithm, which should not be utilized as it is considered
    to be broken.
