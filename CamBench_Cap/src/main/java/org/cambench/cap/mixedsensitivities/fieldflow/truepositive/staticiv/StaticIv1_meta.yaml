name:
  Static Initialization Vector Field- & Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  A static (string-based) and a pseudorandom byte array are stored in an object's fields.
  The static one is then utilized to create an initialization vector and initialize an instance of the AES algorithm
  before it is overwritten with a pseudorandom byte array.

fix:
  description:
    Use the SecureRandom class to create a pseudorandom byte array instead of using a static byte array for iv creation.

  issue-description:
    A static byte array is used to create an initialization vector. This can lead to insecurities, since initialization
    vectors are often required to be random in order to guarantee a secure encryption.
