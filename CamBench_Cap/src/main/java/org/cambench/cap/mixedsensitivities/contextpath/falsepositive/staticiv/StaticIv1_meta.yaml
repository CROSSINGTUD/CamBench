  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  A static and a random, non-static byte array are created with the identity function.
  The random, non-static array is then chosen in the reachable branch of the conditional statement 
  and used as initialization vector to initialize an instance of the AES algorithm.
