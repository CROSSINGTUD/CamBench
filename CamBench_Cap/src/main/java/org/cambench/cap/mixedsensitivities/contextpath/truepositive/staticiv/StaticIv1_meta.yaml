  Static Initialization Vector Path- And Context-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  A static and a random, non-static byte array are created with the identity function.
  The static array is then chosen in the reachable branch of the conditional statement 
  and used as initialization vector to initialize an instance of the AES algorithm.

  description:
    Use the SecureRandom class to create a pseudorandom byte array instead of using a static value for iv creation.

  issue-description:
    A static value is used to create an initialization vector. This can lead to insecurities, since initialization
    vectors are often required to be random in order to guarantee a secure encryption.
