name:
  Broken Crypto Field- & Flow-Sensitive False-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  The names of two insecure ciphers (Blowfish and DES) are stored in an object's fields. 
  The field containing the Blowfish value is then sanitized by re-assigning it with the name of a secure
  algorithm (AES) before being used to create an instance of the AES cipher.
