  Small Key Size Path- And Field-Sensitive True-Positive Case 2

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  Two different key sizes (1024 and 2048) are stored in an object's fields.
  The bigger key size is then used in the reachable branch of the conditional statement 
  to create a key pair and initialize an instance of the RSA algorithm.

  description:
    Increase the key size to the recommended value of 2048 bits or more for the RSA algorithm.

  issue-description:
    The size of the generated keys does not conform the recommended minimum of 2048 bits.
    Smaller key sizes can lead to insecurities when using the RSA algorithm.
    Beyond 2023 the minimum key length will be 3072 bits.
