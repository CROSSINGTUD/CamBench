name:
  Broken Crypto Path- And Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two objects are created that each have a string with the name of a cryptographic cipher 
  as value (DES and AES, respectively). The object containing the DES string is then 
  used in the reachable branch of the conditional statement to create an instance of the cipher.

  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).

  issue-description:
    A cipher object is initialized based on the DES algorithm, which should not be utilized as it is considered
    to be broken.
