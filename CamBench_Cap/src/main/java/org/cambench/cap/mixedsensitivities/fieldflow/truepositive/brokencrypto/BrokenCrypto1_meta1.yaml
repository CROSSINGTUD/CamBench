name:
  Broken Crypto Field- & Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  The names of two insecure ciphers (Blowfish and DES) are stored in an object's fields. 
  The field containing the Blowfish value is then sanitized by re-assigning it with the name of a secure
  algorithm (AES) before the other field is used to create an instance of the DES cipher.

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).

    A cipher object is initialized based on the DES algorithm, which should not be utilized as it is considered
    to be broken.
