  Insecure Random Field- & Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  Two objects of class Random are created and stored in another object's fields.
  One field is re-assigned with an object of the SecureRandom class.
  The other field is then utilized to create an initialization vector (iv) for a cipher.

  description:
    Replace the used object of the "Random" class with an object of the "SecureRandom" class
    to generate a byte array for an iv.

    The "Random" class is used to generate a random byte array, which can lead to insecurities.
    For cryptographic use cases, the "SecureRandom" class should be used.
