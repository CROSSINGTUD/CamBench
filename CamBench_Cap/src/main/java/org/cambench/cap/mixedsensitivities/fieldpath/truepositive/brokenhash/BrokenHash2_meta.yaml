name:
  Broken Hash Function Path- And Field-Sensitive True-Positive Case 2

api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  The names of a secure (SHA-256) & an insecure hash algorithm (SHA-1) are stored in an object's fields, depending
  on the conditional statement.
  An insecure one is then used to get an instance of the hash algorithm.

crypto-usage:
  violation: true

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure hash algorithm with a secure hash algorithm (e.g. SHA-256).

  issue-description:
    SHA-1 is a broken hash algorithm and should therefore not be used for its cryptographic properties.
