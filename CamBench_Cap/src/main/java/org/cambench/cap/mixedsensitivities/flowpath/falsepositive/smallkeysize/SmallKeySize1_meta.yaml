  Small Key Size Path- And Flow-Sensitive False-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  A variable is set to a keySize of 512 bits.
  The variable is re-assigned in the reachable branch of the conditional statement with a keySize of 2048
  bits, before it is used to generate a KeyPair for the RSA algorithm.
