name:
  Broken Hash Function Path- And Field-Sensitive True-Positive Case 2
api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  The names of a broken hash algorithm (SHA-1) and a secure one (SHA-256) are stored in variables
  via the identity function and depending on the conditional statement.
  The variable with the insecure algorithm name is then used to get an instance of the algorithm.

crypto-usage:
  violation: true

  issue-description:
    SHA-1 is a broken hash algorithm and should therefore not be used for its cryptographic properties.
