  ECB Mode Field- & Flow-Sensitive False-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two configurations of the AES algorithm are stored in an object's fields. 
  One contains the secure CBC mode of operation, the other the insecure ECB mode. 
  The field containing the secure one is then used to initialize an instance of the AES cipher before it is re-assigned
  with an insecure configuration.
