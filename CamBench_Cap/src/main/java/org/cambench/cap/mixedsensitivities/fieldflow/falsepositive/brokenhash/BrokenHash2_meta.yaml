name:
  Broken Hash Function Field- & Flow-Sensitive False-Positive Case 2

api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  The names of a secure (SHA-256) & an insecure hash algorithm (SHA-1) are stored in an object's fields. The secure one
  is then used to get a MessageDigest object and compute the hash of some data before the field is re-assigned with
  the name of an insecure algorithm.
