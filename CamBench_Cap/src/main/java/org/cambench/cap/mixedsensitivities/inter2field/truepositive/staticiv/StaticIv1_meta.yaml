name:
  Static Initialization Vector 2-Interprocedural Field-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  A static (string-based) and a pseudorandom byte array are stored in an object's fields.
  The static one is then passed to a method and utilized to create an initialization vector 
  and initialize an instance of the AES algorithm.

fix:
  description:
    Use the SecureRandom class to create a pseudorandom byte array instead of using a static byte array for iv creation.

  issue-description:
    A static byte array is used to create an initialization vector. This can lead to insecurities, since initialization
    vectors are often required to be random in order to guarantee a secure encryption.
