name:
  Broken Crypto Path- And Context-Sensitive True-Positive Case 2

api:
  javax.crypto.KeyGenerator

description:
  The names of an insecure (Blowfish) and a secure cipher (AES) are saved into by using the
  Identity function and depending on the branches of the conditional statement.
  Then the variable containing the Blowfish algorithm is used to get an instance of the KeyGenerator.

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure algorithm with a secure one (e.g. AES, depending on the algorithm used for the cipher object).

  issue-description:
    The KeyGenerator is initialized with an insecure algorithm. Since insecure algorithms should not be utilized
    to create cipher objects, they also should not be utilized to create the according keys.
