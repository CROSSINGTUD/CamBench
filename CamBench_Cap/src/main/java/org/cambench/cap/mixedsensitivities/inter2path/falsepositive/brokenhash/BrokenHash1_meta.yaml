  Broken Hash Function 2-Interprocedural Path-Sensitive False-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  A secure hash algorithm (SHA-256) is passed to a method in the reachable branch of a conditional statement, where it
  is used to create a MessageDigest object and compute the hash value of some data.
  The other branch passes an insecure algorithm (MD5) to the same method, but is never reached.
