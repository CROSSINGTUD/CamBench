  Broken Hash Function 2-Interprocedural Path-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  An insecure hash algorithm (MD5) is passed to a method in the reachable branch of a conditional statement, where it
  is used to create a MessageDigest object and compute the hash value of some data.
  The other branch passes a secure algorithm (SHA-256) to the same method, but is never reached.

    Replace the insecure hash algorithm with a secure hash algorithm (e.g. SHA-256)

  issue-description:
    MD5 is a broken hash algorithm and should therefore not be used for its cryptographic properties.
