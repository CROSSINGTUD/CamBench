  Small Key Size 2-Interprocedural Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 2

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  A variable is set to a sufficient key size (2048 bits) before it is overwritten with a small key size (1024 bits) and
  passed as argument to a method where it is used to generate a KeyPair for the RSA algorithm.

fix:
  description:
    Increase the key size to the recommended value of 2048 bits or more for the RSA algorithm.

  issue-description:
    The size of the generated keys does not conform the recommended minimum of 2048 bits.
    Smaller key sizes can lead to insecurities when using the RSA algorithm.
