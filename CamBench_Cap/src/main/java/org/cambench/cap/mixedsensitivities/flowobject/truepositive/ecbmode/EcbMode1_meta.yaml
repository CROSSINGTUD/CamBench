name:
  ECB Mode Flow- & Object-Sensitive False-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two objects are created that each store a string with a configuration of the AES algorithm that uses 
  the ECB or CBC mode of operation. These strings are re-assigned, however, ECB is utilized to initialize a cipher object.

fix:
  description:
    Do not utilize the ECB mode of operation. Instead, use a more secure mode, such as CBC.

  issue-description:
    Block ciphers should not be used with the ECB mode of operation. ECB mode is considered to be insecure since
    identical blocks of plaintext will be encrypted to identical blocks of ciphertext.
