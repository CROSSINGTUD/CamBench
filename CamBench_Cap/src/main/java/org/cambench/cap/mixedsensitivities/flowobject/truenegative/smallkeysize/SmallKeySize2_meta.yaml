  Small Key Size Flow- & Object-Sensitive True-Negative Case 2

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  Two objects are created that each contain an integer that defines a key size of 1024 bit. One of the integers is
  re-assigned with a bigger key size of 2048 and is then used to create a keyPair for the initialization of the RSA algorithm.
