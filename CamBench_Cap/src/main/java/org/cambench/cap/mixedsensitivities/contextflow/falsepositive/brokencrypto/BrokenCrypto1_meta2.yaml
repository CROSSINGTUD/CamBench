name:
  Broken Crypto Context- & Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.KeyGenerator

description:
  The algo variables are set to the names of an insecure (DES) and a secure cipher (AES) by using the
  identity function.
  The insecure one is then utilized to get an instance of the KeyGenerator before the variable 
  is re-assigned with the name of a secure cipher.

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure algorithm with a secure one (e.g. AES, depending on the algorithm used for the cipher object).

  issue-description:
    The KeyGenerator is initialized with an insecure algorithm. Since insecure algorithms should not be utilized
    to create cipher objects, they also should not be utilized to create the according keys.
