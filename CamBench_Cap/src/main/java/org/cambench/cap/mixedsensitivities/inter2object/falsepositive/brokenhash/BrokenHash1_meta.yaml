name:
  Broken Hash Function 2-Interprocedural Object-Sensitive False-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  Two objects are created that each hold the name of a hash algorithm. One contains the insecure MD5 algorithm, the 
  other one the secure SHA-256 algorithm. The object with the secure hash algorithm is then passed to a method and is
  used to initialize a MessageDigest object that generates the hash of some data.
