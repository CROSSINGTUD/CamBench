name:
  Broken Crypto 2-Interprocedural Context-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.KeyGenerator

description:
  The algo variables are set to an insecure (DES) and a secure cipher (AES), respectively, 
  by using the Identity function.
  The insecure one is then utilized to get an instance of the KeyGenerator.

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure algorithm with a secure one (e.g. AES, depending on the algorithm used for the cipher object).

  issue-description:
    The KeyGenerator is initialized with an insecure algorithm. Since insecure algorithms should not be utilized
    to create cipher objects, they also should not be utilized to create the according keys.
