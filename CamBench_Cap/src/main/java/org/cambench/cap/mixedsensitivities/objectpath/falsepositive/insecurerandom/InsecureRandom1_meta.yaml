description:
  Two objects are created in each branch of the conditional statement that each contain one object of a Random generator.
  The first one contains an object of the Random class, the second one contains an object of the SecureRandom class. 
  The object containing the (secure) SecureRandom object is then used to create an initialization vector for a cipher.
