  Insecure Random Path- And Field-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  An object of class Random and one of class SecureRandom are created and stored in another object's fields.
  The instance of the Random class is chosen in the reachable branch of the conditional statement
  to fill a byte array which is then used to create an initialization vector (iv) for a cipher.

  description:
    Replace the used object of the "Random" class with an object of the "SecureRandom" class
    to generate a byte array for an iv.

  issue-description:
    The "Random" class is used to generate a random byte array, which can lead to insecurities.
    For cryptographic use cases, the "SecureRandom" class should be used.
