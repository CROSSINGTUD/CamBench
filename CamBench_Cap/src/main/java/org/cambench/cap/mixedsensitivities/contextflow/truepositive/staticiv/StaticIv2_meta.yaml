  Static Initialization Vector Context- & Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 2

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  A static and a random byte array are stored in variables by using the identity function.
  The static iv is then used to create an initialization vector for the initialization
  of an instance of the AES cipher, before the variable is re-assigned with a random byte array.

    Using a static initialization vector (iv) can lead to vulnerabilities regarding the encryption of data.
    Therefore, an iv should always be a random value.
