  Insecure Random Field- & Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  Objects of class Random and class SecureRandom are created and stored in the fields of two objects.
  One of the fields containing an object of class Random is then utilized to create an initialization vector (iv) for a cipher.

  description:
    Replace the used object of the "Random" class with an object of the "SecureRandom" class
    to generate a byte array for an iv.

    The "Random" class is used to generate a random byte array, which can lead to insecurities.
    For cryptographic use cases, the "SecureRandom" class should be used.
