  Small Key Size 2-Interprocedural Context-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  Two different key sizes (1024 and 2048) are stored in variables by using the Identity function. 
  The smaller key size is then passed to a method and used to initialize an instance of the RSA algorithm for encryption.

  issue-description:
    The key-pair that is used for the RSA algorithm is initialized with a too small size (1024 bits).
    As recommended by NIST, RSA keys should be at least of 2048 bits.
