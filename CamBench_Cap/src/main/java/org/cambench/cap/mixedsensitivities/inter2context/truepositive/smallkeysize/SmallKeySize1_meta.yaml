name:
  Small Key Size 2-Interprocedural Context-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  Two different key sizes (1024 and 2048) are stored in variables by using the Identity function. 
  The smaller key size is then passed to a method and used to initialize an instance of the RSA algorithm for encryption.

  issue-description:
    The size of the generated keys does not conform the recommended minimum of 2048 bits.
    Smaller key sizes can lead to insecurities when using the RSA algorithm.
    Beyond 2023 the minimum key length will be 3072 bits.
