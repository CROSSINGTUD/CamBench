  Static Initialization Vector Path- And Context-Sensitive True-Positive Case 2

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  A static and a random, non-static byte array are created with the identity function and stored as
  variables, depending on the conditional statement.
  The static array is then used as initialization vector to initialize an instance of the AES algorithm.

  description:
    Use the SecureRandom class to create a pseudorandom byte array instead of using a static value for iv creation.

  issue-description:
    A static value is used to create an initialization vector. This can lead to insecurities, since initialization
    vectors are often required to be random in order to guarantee a secure encryption.
