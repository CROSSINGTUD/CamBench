name:
  Broken Hash Function Path- And Field-Sensitive False-Positive Case 2
api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  The names of a broken hash algorithm (SHA-1) and a secure one (SHA-256) are stored in variables
  via the identity function and depending on the conditional statement.
  The variable with the secure algorithm name is then used to get an instance of the algorithm.
