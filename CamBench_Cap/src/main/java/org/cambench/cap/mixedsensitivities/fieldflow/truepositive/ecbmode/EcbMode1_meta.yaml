name:
  ECB Mode Field- & Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two configurations of the AES algorithm are stored in an object's fields. 
  One contains the secure CBC mode of operation, the other the insecure ECB mode. 
  The field containing the latter one is then used to initialize an instance of the AES cipher before it is re-assigned
  with a secure configuration.

fix:
  description:
    Do not utilize the ECB mode of operation. Instead, use a more secure mode, like CBC.

  issue-description:
    Block ciphers should not be used with the ECB mode of operation. ECB mode is considered to be insecure since
    identical blocks of plaintext will be encrypted to identical blocks of ciphertext.
