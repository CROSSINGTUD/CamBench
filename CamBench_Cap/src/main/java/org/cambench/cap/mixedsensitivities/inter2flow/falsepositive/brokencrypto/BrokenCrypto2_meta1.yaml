description:
  A string containing the name of a secure cipher (AES) is overwritten with the name of an insecure cipher (Blowfish) 
  before it is passed to a method where it is used to initialize a cipher object for encryption.

  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).

  issue-description:
    A cipher object is initialized based on the Blowfish algorithm, which should not be utilized since there exist
    attacks on 64-bit block ciphers like sweet32.
