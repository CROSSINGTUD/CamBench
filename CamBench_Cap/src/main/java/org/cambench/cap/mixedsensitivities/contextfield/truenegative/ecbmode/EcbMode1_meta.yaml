  ECB Mode Context- & Field-Sensitive True-Negative Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two configurations of the AES algorithm are stored in an object's fields by using the Identity function. 
  One contains the secure CBC mode of operation, the other the insecure ECB mode. 
  The CBC configuration is then used to initialize an instance of the AES cipher.
