  Static Initialization Vector 2-Interprocedural Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 2

description:
  A static byte array is passed to a method where it is used to create an initialization vector for cipher initialization
  before it is overwritten with random values.

  description:
    Use the SecureRandom class to create a pseudorandom byte array instead of using a static value for iv creation.

  issue-description:
    A static value is used to create an initialization vector. This can lead to insecurities, since initialization
    vectors are often required to be random in order to guarantee a secure encryption.
