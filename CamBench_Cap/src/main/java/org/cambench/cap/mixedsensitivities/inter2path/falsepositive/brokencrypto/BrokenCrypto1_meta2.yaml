description:
  A string containing the name of an insecure cipher (DES) is passed to a method in the 
  reachable branch of a conditional statement where it is used to create an instance of the KeyGenerator .
  The other branch, which is never reached, passes the name of a secure cipher (AES) to that method.

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure algorithm with a secure one (e.g. AES, depending on the algorithm used for the cipher object).

  issue-description:
    The KeyGenerator is initialized with an insecure algorithm. Since insecure algorithms should not be utilized
    to create cipher objects, they also should not be utilized to create the according keys.
