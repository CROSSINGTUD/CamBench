name:
  ECB Mode Context- & Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two configurations of the AES algorithm (one with ECB and one with CBC mode of operation) are stored in variables
  by using the identity function.
  The insecure ECB configuration is then used to initialize a cipher object for encryption before the variable
  containing it is re-assigned with a secure configuration.

  description:
    Replace the ECB mode in the configuration with another, more secure mode like CBC.

  issue-description:
    The AES block cipher is initialized with the ECB mode of operation. This configuration should not be used because
    blocks with the same value will be encrypted to the same ciphertext with ECB mode, which is insecure.
