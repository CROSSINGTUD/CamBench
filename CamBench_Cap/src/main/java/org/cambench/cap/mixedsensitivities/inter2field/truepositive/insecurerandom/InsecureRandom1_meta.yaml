  Insecure Random 2-Interprocedural Field-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  An object of class Random and one of class SecureRandom are created and stored in another object's fields.
  The instance of the Random class is then passed to a method and utilized to 
  create an initialization vector (iv) for a cipher.

    Replace the used object of the "Random" class with an object of the "SecureRandom" class
    to generate a byte array for an iv.

  issue-description:
    The "Random" class is used to generate a random byte array, which can lead to insecurities.
    For cryptographic use cases, the "SecureRandom" class should be used.
