  Static Initialization Vector 2-Interprocedural Path-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  The byte array for the iv initialization is set to a static value based on a string in the reachable branch of the conditional statement.
  In the other branch, which is never reached, the byte array is filled with random values.
  The byte array is then passed to a method where it is used to create an initialization vector.

  description:
    Use the SecureRandom class to create a pseudorandom byte array instead of using a static value for iv creation.

    A static value is used to create an initialization vector. This can lead to insecurities, since initialization
    vectors are often required to be random in order to guarantee a secure encryption.
