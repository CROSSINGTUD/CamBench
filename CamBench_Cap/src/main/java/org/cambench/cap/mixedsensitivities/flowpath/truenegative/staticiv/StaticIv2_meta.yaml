  Static Initialization Vector Path- And Flow-Sensitive True-Negative Case 2

api:
  - javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  A byte array is created and filled by using the SecureRandom class. In the reachable branch of the
  conditional statement the array is re-assigned to itself, whereas the unreachable branch would assign 
  a byte array with static values to it. The array is then used as initialization vector for a cipher.
