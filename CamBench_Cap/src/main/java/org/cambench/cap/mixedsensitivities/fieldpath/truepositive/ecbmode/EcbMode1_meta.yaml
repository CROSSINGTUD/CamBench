name:
  ECB Mode Path- And Field-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two configurations of the AES algorithm are stored in an objects fields. 
  One contains the secure CBC mode of operation, the other the insecure ECB mode. 
  The insecure configuration is then used in the reachable branch of the conditional statement to get an instance of the
  cipher.

fix:
  description:
    Do not utilize the ECB mode of operation. Instead, use a more secure mode, such as CBC.

  issue-description:
    Block ciphers should not be used with the ECB mode of operation. ECB mode is considered to be insecure since
    identical blocks of plaintext will be encrypted to identical blocks of ciphertext.
