  Broken Hash Path-Sensitive Path-Depth-3 True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  An instance of an insecure hash algorithm (MD4) is used in the reachable 
  branch of a nested conditional statement with depth 3.
  In every other branch, of which none are reached,
  The unreached branches hold a secure algorithm (SHA-256) and an insecure ones (SHA-1, MD5).

  issue-description:
    MD4 is a broken hash algorithm and should therefore not be used for its cryptographic properties.
