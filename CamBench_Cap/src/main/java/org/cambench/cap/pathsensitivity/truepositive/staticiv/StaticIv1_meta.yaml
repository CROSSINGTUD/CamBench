  Static Initialization Vector Path-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  The byte array for the iv initialization is set to a static value in the reachable branch of the conditional statement.
  The other branch overwrites the content of the byte array with random values, but is never reached.

  description:
    Use the SecureRandom class to create a pseudorandom byte array instead of using a static value for iv creation.

  issue-description:
    A static value is used to create an initialization vector. This can lead to insecurities, since initialization
    vectors are often required to be random in order to guarantee a secure encryption.
