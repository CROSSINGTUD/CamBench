  Small Key Size Path-Sensitive Path-Depth-2 False-Positive Case 1

api:
  - java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  A sufficient key size (2048 bits) for the RSA algorithm is set in the reachable 
  branch of a nested conditional statement with depth 2 and then used to create a KeyPair.
  In every other branch, of which none are reached, an insufficient KeySize (512 and 1024 bit) would have been used.
