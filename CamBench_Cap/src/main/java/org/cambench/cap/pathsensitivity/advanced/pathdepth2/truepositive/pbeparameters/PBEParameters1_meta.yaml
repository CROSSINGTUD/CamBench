description:
  The salt used to create a PBEParameterSpec object is a static value in the reachable branch of a nested conditional
  statement with depth 2.
  The unreached branches hold a static value or is using the SecureRandom class to generate a securely random value.

    Replace the static array that is used as salt with an array that was filled with random values
    from the SecureRandom class.

  issue-description:
    The salt that is used for the PBEParameterSpec is a small static value, which is predictable and can
    therefore lead to security issues.
