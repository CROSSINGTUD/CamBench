  Static Initialization Vector Path-Sensitive Path-Depth-2 True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  The byte array used for iv creation is filled with static values in the 
  reachable branch of a nested conditional statement with depth 2.
  In the unreachable branches insecure static values or securely random values would have been used.

  description:
    Use the SecureRandom class to create a pseudorandom byte array instead of using a static value for iv creation.

  issue-description:
    A static value is used to create an initialization vector. This can lead to insecurities, since initialization
    vectors are often required to be random in order to guarantee a secure encryption.
