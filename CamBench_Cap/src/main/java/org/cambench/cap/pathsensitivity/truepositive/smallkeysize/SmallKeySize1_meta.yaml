  Small Key Size Path-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  The RSA algorithm is initialized with an insufficient key size (1024 bits) in a conditional branch.
  The other branch of the condition sets the key size to 2048 bit, but is never reached.

fix:
  description:
    Increase the key size to the recommended value of 2048 bits or more for the RSA algorithm.

  issue-description:
    The size of the generated keys does not conform the recommended minimum of 2048 bits.
    Smaller key sizes can lead to insecurities when using the RSA algorithm.
