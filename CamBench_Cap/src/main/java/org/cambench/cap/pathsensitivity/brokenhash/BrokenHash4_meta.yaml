name:
  Broken Hash Function Path-sensitivity Case 4

api:
  - java.security.MessageDigest;

description:
  A broken hash algorithm (SHA-1) is initialized in a conditional branch that is never reached.
  The reached branch initializes a safe hash algorithm (SHA-256), bearing no actual violation.

violations:
  - argument_state/string_format
