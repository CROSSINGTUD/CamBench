name:
  Broken Hash Path-Sensitive Path-Depth-3 Case 1

api:
  - javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  An instance of a secure hash algorithm (SHA-256) is used in the reachable branch of a nested conditional statement with depth 3.
  In every other branch, of which none are reached, an instance of a broken hash algorithm (MD2, MD5, SHA.1) would be used.
