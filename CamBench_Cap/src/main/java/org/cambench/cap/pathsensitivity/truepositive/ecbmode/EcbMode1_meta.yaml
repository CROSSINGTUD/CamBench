  Ecb Mode Path-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:

description:
  An instance of a secure cipher (AES) is used with ECB mode of operation
  in the reachable branch of a conditional statement.
  The other branch, which is never reached, gets an instance of the cipher with CBC mode of operation configured.

fix:
  description:
    Replace the ECB mode of operation through another, secure mode, e.g. CBC mode.

  issue-description:
    Block ciphers should not be used with the ECB mode of operation. ECB mode is considered to be insecure since
    identical blocks of plaintext will be encrypted to identical blocks of ciphertext.
