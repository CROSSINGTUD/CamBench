  Insecure Random Path-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  The byte array used for the creation of an initialization vector is filled with random values in an insecure way 
  in the reachable branch of the conditional statement by using the standard Random class. 
  The other branch, which is not reached, uses the standard SecureRandom class to fill the byte array in a secure way.

  description:
    Replace the used object of the "Random" class with an object of the "SecureRandom" class
    to generate a byte array for an iv.

    The "Random" class is used to generate a random byte array, which can lead to insecurities.
    For cryptographic use cases, the "SecureRandom" class should be used.
