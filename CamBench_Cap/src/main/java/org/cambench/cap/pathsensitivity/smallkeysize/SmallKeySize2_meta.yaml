name:
  Small Key Size Path-sensitive Case 2

api:
  - javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  The RSA algorithm is initialized with a sufficient key size (2048 bits) in a conditional branch.
  The other branch of the condition sets the key size to 1024 bit, but is never reached.

violations:
  - argument_state/number_range
