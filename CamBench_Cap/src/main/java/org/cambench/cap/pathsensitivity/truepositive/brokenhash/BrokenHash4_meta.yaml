name:
  Broken Hash Function Path-Sensitive True-Positive Case 4

api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  A secure hash algorithm (SHA-256) is initialized in a conditional branch that is never reached.
  The reached branch initializes an insecure hash algorithm (SHA-1).

crypto-usage:
  violation: true

  issue-description:
    SHA-1 is a broken hash algorithm and should therefore not be used for its cryptographic properties.
