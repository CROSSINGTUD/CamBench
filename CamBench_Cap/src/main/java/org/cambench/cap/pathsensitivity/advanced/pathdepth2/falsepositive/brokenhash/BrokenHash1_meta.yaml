  Broken Hash Path-Sensitive Path-Depth-2 False-Positive Case 1

api:
  - java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  An instance of a secure hash algorithm (SHA-256) is used in the reachable branch of a nested conditional statement with depth 2.
  In every other branch, of which none are reached, an instance of a broken hash algorithm (MD5, SHA-1) would be used.
