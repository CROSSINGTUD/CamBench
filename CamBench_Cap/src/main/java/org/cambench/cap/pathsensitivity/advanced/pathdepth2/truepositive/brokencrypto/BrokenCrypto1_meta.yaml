  Broken Crypto Path-Sensitive Path-Depth 2 True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  An instance of an insecure cipher (DES) is used in the reachable branch of a nested conditional statement with depth 2.
  In the other branches, of which none are reached, an instance of an insecure cipher (Blowfish) and a secure 
  cipher (AES) would have been used.

  description:
    Change the condition to use a secure cipher (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).

    A cipher object is initialized based on the DES algorithm, which should not be utilized as it is considered
    to be broken.
