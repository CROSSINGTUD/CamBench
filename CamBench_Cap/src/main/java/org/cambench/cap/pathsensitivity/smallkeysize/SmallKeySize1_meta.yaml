api:
  - java.security

description:
  The RSA algorithm is initialized with a sufficient key size (2048 bits) but
  the else branch, of the condition (although never reached) sets the key size to 512 bit.

#[required]
fix:
  Initialize the RSA algorithm with keys of at least 2048 bits and remove unnecessary statements.
