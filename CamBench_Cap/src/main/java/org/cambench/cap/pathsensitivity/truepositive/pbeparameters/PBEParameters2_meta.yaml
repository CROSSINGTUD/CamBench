  issue-description:
    The iteration count that is used for the PBEParameterSpec is a small value, which is not sufficient.
    Since the iteration count is meant to increase the difficulty of attacks, its value should be at least
    10.000.000. This value is an approximation since a concrete value is currently an open discussion for
    standardization (c.f. https://csrc.nist.gov/news/2023/proposal-to-revise-nist-sp-800-132-pbkdf).
    We chose this value to reflect a reasonable magnitude with relevance for industry
    (cf. https://help.apple.com/pdf/security/en_US/apple-platform-security-guide.pdf - p.81).
