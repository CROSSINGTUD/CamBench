  Broken Crypto Path-Sensitive Path-Depth 3 True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  An instance of an insecure cipher (RC4) is used in the reachable branch of a nested conditional statement with depth 2.
  In the other branches, of which none are reached, an instances of insecure ciphers (Blowfish, DES) and a secure
  cipher (AES) would have been used.

  description:
    Change the condition to use a secure cipher (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).
