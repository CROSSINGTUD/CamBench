description:
  An insufficient key size (2048 bits) for the RSA algorithm is set in the reachable 
  branch of a nested conditional statement with depth 3 and then used to create a KeyPair.
  In the unreachable branches an insufficient KeySize (512) and a sufficient (2048 bit) would have been used.

  description:
    Increase the key size to the recommended value of 2048 bits or more for the RSA algorithm.

  issue-description:
    The size of the generated keys does not conform the recommended minimum of 2048 bits.
    Smaller key sizes can lead to insecurities when using the RSA algorithm.
    Beyond 2023 the minimum key length will be 3072 bits.
