name:
  Broken Hash Function Path-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  A secure hash algorithm (SHA-256) is initialized in a conditional branch that is never reached.
  The reached branch initializes an insecure hash algorithm (MD5).

crypto-usage:
  violation: true

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure hash algorithm with a secure hash algorithm (e.g. SHA-256)

  issue-description:
    MD5 is a broken hash algorithm and should therefore not be used for its cryptographic properties.
