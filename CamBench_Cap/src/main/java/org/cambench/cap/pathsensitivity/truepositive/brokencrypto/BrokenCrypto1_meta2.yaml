name:
  Broken Crypto Path-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.KeyGenerator

description:
  An insecure algorithm (DES) is used in the reachable branch of a conditional statement 
  to get an instance of the KeyGenerator.
  The other branch, which is never reached, would have used a secure algorithm (AES).

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure algorithm with a secure one (e.g. AES, depending on the algorithm used for the cipher object).

  issue-description:
    The KeyGenerator is initialized with an insecure algorithm. Since insecure algorithms should not be utilized
    to create cipher objects, they also should not be utilized to create the according keys.
