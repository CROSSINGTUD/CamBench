name:
  Broken Hash Function Path-Sensitive Case 2

api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  A broken hash algorithm (SHA-1) is initialized in a conditional branch that is never reached.
  The reached branch initializes a safe hash algorithm (SHA-256), bearing no actual violation.

crypto-usage:
  violation: false
  FUM:
    - argument_state/string_format
