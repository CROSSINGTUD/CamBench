  Broken Crypto Field-Sensitive Field-Depth 3 True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  The names of a secure & an insecure cipher (DES) are stored in an object's fields which is the end of a chain of
  three objects (getting a field-depth of 3, e.g. object.field.field.field). The insecure one is then used 
  to initialize the actual cipher object.

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).

  issue-description:
    A cipher object is initialized based on the DES algorithm, which should not be utilized as it is considered
    to be broken.
