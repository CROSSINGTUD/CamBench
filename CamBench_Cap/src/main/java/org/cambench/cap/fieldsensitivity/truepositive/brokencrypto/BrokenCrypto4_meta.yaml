description:
  The names of a secure & an insecure cipher (RC4) are stored in an object's fields. The insecure one is then used
  to initialize the actual cipher object.

    A cipher object is initialized based on the RC4 algorithm, which should not be utilized since it is attackable
    in several scenarios (especially SSL/TLS).
