  Insecure Random Field-Sensitive Case 1

api:
  - javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  An object of class Random and one of class SecureRandom are created and stored in another object's fields.
  The instance of the Random class is then utilized to create an initialization vector (iv) for a cipher.
