name:
  Static Initialization Vector Field-Sensitive True-Positive Case 2

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  A static and a pseudorandom byte array are stored in an object's fields.
  The static one is then utilized to create an initialization vector and initialize an instance of the AES algorithm.

crypto-usage:
  violation: true

fix:
  description:
    Use the SecureRandom class to create a pseudorandom byte array instead of using a static byte array for iv creation.

  issue-description:
    A static byte array is used to create an initialization vector. This can lead to insecurities, since initialization
    vectors are often required to be random in order to guarantee a secure encryption.
