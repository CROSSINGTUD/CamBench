name:
  Broken Crypto Field-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.KeyGenerator

description:
  The names of a secure (AES) & an insecure cipher (DES) are stored in an object's fields. The insecure one is then used 
  to get an instance of the KeyGenerator.

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure algorithm with a secure one (e.g. AES, depending on the algorithm used for the cipher object).

  issue-description:
    The KeyGenerator is initialized with an insecure algorithm. Since insecure algorithms should not be utilized
    to create cipher objects, they also should not be utilized to create the according keys.
