description:
  The two byte arrays (a random and a static one) are stored in an object's fields that is stored in an object's
  field itself (getting a field-depth of 2, e.g. object.field.field). The static array is then used as salt
  in for the creation of a PBEParameterSpec.

  description:
    Replace the static array that is used as salt with an array that was filled with random values
    from the SecureRandom class.

  issue-description:
    The salt that is used for the PBEParameterSpec is a small static value, which is predictable and can
    therefore lead to security issues.
