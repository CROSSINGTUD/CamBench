  Broken Crypto Field-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  The names of a secure (AES) & an insecure cipher (DES) are stored in an object's fields. The insecure one is then used 
  to initialize the actual cipher object.

  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).
