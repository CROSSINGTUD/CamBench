description:
  Two byte arrays (one static, one with random values) are stored in an object's fields.
  The static array is then used as salt for an PBEParameterSpec object.

  description:
    Replace the static array that is used as salt with an array that was filled with random values
    from the SecureRandom class.

    The salt that is used for the PBEParameterSpec is a small static value, which is predictable and can
    therefore lead to security issues.
