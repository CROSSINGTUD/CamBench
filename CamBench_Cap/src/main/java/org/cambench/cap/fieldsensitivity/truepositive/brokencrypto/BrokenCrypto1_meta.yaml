  Broken Crypto Field-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

description:
  The names of a secure (AES) & an insecure cipher (Blowfish) are stored in an object's fields. The insecure one is then used 
  to initialize the actual cipher object.

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).

  issue-description:
    A cipher object is initialized based on the Blowfish algorithm, which should not be utilized since there exist
    attacks on 64-bit block ciphers like sweet32.
