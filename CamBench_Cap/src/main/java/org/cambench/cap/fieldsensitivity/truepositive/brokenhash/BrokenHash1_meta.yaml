name:
  Broken Hash Function Field-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  The names of a secure (SHA-256) & an insecure hash algorithm (MD5) are stored in an object's fields. The insecure one 
  is then used to get a MessageDigest object and compute the hash of some data.

crypto-usage:
  violation: true

  description:
    Replace the insecure hash algorithm with a secure hash algorithm (e.g. SHA-256).

  issue-description:
    MD5 is a broken hash algorithm and should therefore not be used for its cryptographic properties.
