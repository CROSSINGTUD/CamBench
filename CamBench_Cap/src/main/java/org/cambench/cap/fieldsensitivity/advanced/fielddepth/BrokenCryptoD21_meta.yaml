name:
  Broken Crypto Field-Sensitive Field-Depth-2 Case 1

api:
  - javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  The names of a secure & an insecure cipher (DES) are stored in variables that are at the end
  of a chain of two fields (e.g. object.field.field). The chain of fields containing the insecure cipher is then used to
  initialize the cipher.

  violation: true

  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).

  issue-description:
    A cipher object is initialized based on the Blowfish algorithm, which should not be utilized since there exist
    attacks on 64-bit block ciphers like sweet32.
