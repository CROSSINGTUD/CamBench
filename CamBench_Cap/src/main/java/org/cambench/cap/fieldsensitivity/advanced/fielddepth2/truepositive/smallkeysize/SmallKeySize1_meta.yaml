  Small Key Size Field-Sensitive Field-Depth 2 True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  Two different key sizes (1024 and 2048) are stored in an object's fields that is stored in an object's
  field itself (getting a field-depth of 2, e.g. object.field.field). The smaller size is then used to 
  create a KeyPair and initialize an instance of the RSA algorithm.

  issue-description:
    The size of the generated keys does not conform the recommended minimum of 2048 bits.
    Smaller key sizes can lead to insecurities when using the RSA algorithm.
    Beyond 2023 the minimum key length will be 3072 bits.
