name:
  Small Key Size Field-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  Two different key sizes (1024 and 2048) are stored in an object's fields. The smaller size is then used to 
  create a KeyPair and initialize an instance of the RSA algorithm.

  issue-description:
    The size of the generated keys does not conform the recommended minimum of 2048 bits.
    Smaller key sizes can lead to insecurities when using the RSA algorithm.
