  A small value of 10 is used as integration count for an PBEParameterSpec object. After the object is created, 
  the value is increased to 20.000, but not again used as integration count.

  issue-description:
    The iteration count that is used for the PBEParameterSpec is a small value, which is not sufficient.
    Since the iteration count is meant to increase the difficulty of attacks, its value should be at least
    1000, as recommended by RFC 2898.
