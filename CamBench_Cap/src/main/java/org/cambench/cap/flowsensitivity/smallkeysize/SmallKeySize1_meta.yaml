name:
  Small Key Size Flow-sensitive Case 1

api:
  - javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  The key size is set to just 512 bit after the RSA algorithm is 
  initialized with sufficient key size of 2048 bit, but it is not initialized again with the small key size.

violations:
  - argument_state/number_range
