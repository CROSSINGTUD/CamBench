name:
  Broken Crypto Field-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.KeyGenerator

description:
  A variable is set to the name of an insecure cipher (DES) and used to get an instance of the KeyGenerator.
  The variable is then re-assigned with the name of a secure cipher (AES).

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure algorithm with a secure one (e.g. AES, depending on the algorithm used for the cipher object).

  issue-description:
    The KeyGenerator is initialized with an insecure algorithm. Since insecure algorithms should not be utilized
    to create cipher objects, they also should not be utilized to create the according keys.
