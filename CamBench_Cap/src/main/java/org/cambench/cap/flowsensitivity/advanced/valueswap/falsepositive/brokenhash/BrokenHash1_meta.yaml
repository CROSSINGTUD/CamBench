name:
  Broken Hash Function Flow-Sensitive Value-Swap False-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  Two variables are created, one containing the name of an insecure hash algorithm (MD5) the other one containing
  a secure one (SHA-256). The values are swapped by using a third variable, s.t. in the end both original variables hold
  the secure algorithm name. One of them is then used to create an instance of that algorithm.
