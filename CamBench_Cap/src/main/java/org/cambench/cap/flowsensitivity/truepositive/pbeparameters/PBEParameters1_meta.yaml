  A static byte array is used as salt for an PBEParameterSpec object. After the object is created, the byte array
  is set to byte array with random values, but not again used as salt.

    The salt that is used for the PBEParameterSpec is a small static value, which is predictable and can
    therefore lead to security issues.
