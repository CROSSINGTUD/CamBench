name:
  Broken Hash Function Flow-Sensitive Value-Swap True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  Two variables are created, one containing the name of an insecure hash algorithm (MD5) the other one containing
  a secure one (SHA-256). The values are swapped by using a third variable, s.t. in the end the insecure algorithm is
  used to create an instance of that algorithm.

crypto-usage:

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure hash algorithm with a secure hash algorithm (e.g. SHA-256).

    MD5 is a broken hash algorithm and should therefore not be used for its cryptographic properties.
