name:
  Broken Hash Function Field-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  A variable is set to the name of an insecure hash algorithm (MD5) and used to create an instance of that algorithm.
  The variable is then re-assigned with the name of a secure hash algorithm (SHA-256).

crypto-usage:
  violation: true

  description:
    Replace the insecure hash algorithm with a secure hash algorithm (e.g. SHA-256).
