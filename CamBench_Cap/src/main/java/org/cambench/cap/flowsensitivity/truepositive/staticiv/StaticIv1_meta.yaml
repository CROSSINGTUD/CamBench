  Static Initialization Vector Flow-sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  After the iv for cipher initialization is created with a static byte array, 
  the array is filled with random values using the SecureRandom class, but no new iv is created.

fix:
  description:
    Use the SecureRandom class to create a pseudorandom byte array instead of using a static value for iv creation.

  issue-description:
    A static value is used to create an initialization vector. This can lead to insecurities, since initialization
    vectors are often required to be random in order to guarantee a secure encryption.
