description:
  A variable is set to the name of an insecure cipher (Blowfish) and used to create a cipher object.
  The variable is then re-assigned with the name of a secure cipher (AES).

    A cipher object is initialized based on the Blowfish algorithm, which should not be utilized since there exist
    attacks on 64-bit block ciphers like sweet32.
