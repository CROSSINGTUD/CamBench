name:
  Small Key Size Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  Two variables are created containing different key sizes (512 and 2048),
  The values are swapped by using a third variable, s.t. in the end the small value is used to create a KeyPair for the
  RSA cipher.

crypto-usage:
  violation: true
  FUM:
    - argument_state/number_range

fix:
  description:
    Increase the key size to the recommended value of 2048 bits or more for the RSA algorithm.

  issue-description:
    The size of the generated keys does not conform the recommended minimum of 2048 bits.
    Smaller key sizes can lead to insecurities when using the RSA algorithm.
