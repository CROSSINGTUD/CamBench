name:
  Broken Crypto Flow-Sensitive Value-Swap True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two variables are created, one containing the name of an insecure cipher (Blowfish) the other one containing 
  a secure cipher (AES). The values are swapped by using a third variable, s.t. in the end the insecure algorithm is 
  used to create an actual cipher object.

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).

  issue-description:
    A cipher object is initialized based on the Blowfish algorithm, which should not be utilized since there exist
    attacks on 64-bit block ciphers like sweet32.
