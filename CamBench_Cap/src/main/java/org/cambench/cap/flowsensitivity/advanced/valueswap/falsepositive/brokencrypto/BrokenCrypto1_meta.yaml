  Broken Crypto Flow-Sensitive Value-Swap False-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two variables are created, one containing the name of an insecure cipher (Blowfish) the other one containing 
  a secure cipher (AES). The values are swapped by using a third variable, s.t. in the end both original variables hold 
  the secure cipher name. One of them is then used to create an actual cipher object.
