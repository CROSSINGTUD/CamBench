name:
  ECB Mode Flow-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.Cipher

description:
  A variable is set to an insecure AES configuration that contains the ECB mode of operation. 
  The variable is used to create a cipher object before it is re-assigned with a more secure
  configuration (containing the GCM mode of operation).

  violation: true

  description:
    Edit the AES configuration to use the GCM mode of operation, instead of ECB mode.

  issue-description:
    Block ciphers should not be used with the ECB mode of operation. ECB mode is considered to be insecure since
    identical blocks of plaintext will be encrypted to identical blocks of ciphertext.
