name:
  Small Key Size Flow-Sensitive False-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  Two variables are created containing different key sizes (512 and 2048),
  The values are swapped by using a third variable, s.t. in the end both original variables hold
  the bigger key size. One of them is then used to create a KeyPair for the RSA cipher.

crypto-usage:
