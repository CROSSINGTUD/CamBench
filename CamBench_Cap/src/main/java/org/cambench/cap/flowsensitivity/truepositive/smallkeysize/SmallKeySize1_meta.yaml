  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  The key size is set to 2048 bit after the RSA algorithm is 
  initialized with an insufficient key size of 1024 bit, but it is not initialized again with the bigger key size.

  description:
    Increase the key size to the recommended value of 2048 bits or more for the RSA algorithm.

  issue-description:
    The size of the generated keys does not conform the recommended minimum of 2048 bits.
    Smaller key sizes can lead to insecurities when using the RSA algorithm.
