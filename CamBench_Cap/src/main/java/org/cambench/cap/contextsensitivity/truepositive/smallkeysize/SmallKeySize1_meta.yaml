name:
  Small Key Size Context-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  Two different key sizes (1024 and 2048) are stored in variables, the smaller key size is then used to
  initialize the instance of the RSA algorithm for encryption.

fix:
  description:
    Increase the key size to the recommended value of 2048 bits or more for the RSA algorithm.

  issue-description:
    The key-pair that is used for the RSA algorithm is initialized with a too small size (1024 bits).
    As recommended by NIST, RSA keys should be at least of 2048 bits.
