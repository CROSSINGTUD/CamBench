  Broken Crypto Context-Sensitive 5-Callsites True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Five variables are set to the names of different secure & insecure ciphers by using the Identity function.
  One variable containing an insecure value is then utilized to initialize the cipher object.

crypto-usage:
  violation: true

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with a proper configuration).

    A cipher object is initialized based on the Blowfish algorithm, which should not be utilized since there exist
    attacks on 64-bit block ciphers like sweet32.
