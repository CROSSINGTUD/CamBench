  Small Key Size Context-Sensitive 5-Callsites True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  Five different key sizes are stored in variables by using the Identity function.
  One of the variables containing an insufficient size is then used to generate a KeyPair.

  issue-description:
    The key-pair that is used for the RSA algorithm is initialized with a too small size (1024 bits).
    As recommended by NIST, RSA keys should be at least of 2048 bits.
