name:
  Broken Crypto Context-Sensitive True-Positive Case 3

api:
  - javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  The algo variables are set to an insecure (RC2) and a secure cipher (AES), respectively.
  The insecure one is then utilized to initialize the cipher object.

  violation: true

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with a secure configuration).

  issue-description:
    A cipher object is initialized based on the RC2 algorithm, which should not be utilized since brute-force
    attacks on 64-bit ciphers are possible.
