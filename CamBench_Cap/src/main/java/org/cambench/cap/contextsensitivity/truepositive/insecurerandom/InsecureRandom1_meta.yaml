description:
  An instance of the Random class and one of the SecureRandom class are created.
  The first one is then used to create an initialization vector (iv) for the cipher initialization.

fix:
  description:
    Instead of the standard Random class, use the SecureRandom class to generate in initialization vector.

    The initialization vector (iv) that is used to initialize an instance of a cipher is created with the standard 
    Random class, which should not be used in a cryptographic context.
