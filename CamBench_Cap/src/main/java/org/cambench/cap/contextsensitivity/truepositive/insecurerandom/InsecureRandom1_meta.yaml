description:
  An instance of the Random class and one of the SecureRandom class are created.
  The first one is then used to create an initialization vector (iv) for the cipher initialization.

    The initialization vector (iv) that is used to initialize an instance of a cipher is created with the standard 
    Random class, which should not be used in a cryptographic context.
