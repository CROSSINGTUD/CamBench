description:
  Two integers (10 and 20.000) are stored in variables by using the Identity function.
  The smaller value is then used as iteration count for an PBEParameterSpec object.

  issue-description:
    The iteration count that is used for the PBEParameterSpec is a small value, which is not sufficient.
    Since the iteration count is meant to increase the difficulty of attacks, its value should be at least
    1000, as recommended by RFC 2898.
