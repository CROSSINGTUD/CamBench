name:
  Small Key Size Context-Sensitive Case 1

api:
  - javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two different key sizes (512 and 2048) are stored in variables, the bigger key size is then used to
  initialize the instance of the RSA algorithm for encryption.

violations:
  - argument_state/number_range
