name:
  Broken Crypto Context-Sensitive True-Positive Basic Case 5

api:
  - javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  The algo variables are set to an insecure (RC5) and a secure cipher (AES), respectively.
  The insecure one is then utilized to initialize the cipher object.

crypto-usage:
  violation: true

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with a proper configuration).
