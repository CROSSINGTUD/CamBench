description:
  Five byte arrays (static or filled with random values) are stored in variables by using the Identity function.
  One variable containing a static array is then used as salt for a PBEParameterSpec object.

    Replace the static array that is used as salt with an array that was filled with random values
    from the SecureRandom class.

  issue-description:
    The salt that is used for the PBEParameterSpec is a small static value, which is predictable and can
    therefore lead to security issues.
