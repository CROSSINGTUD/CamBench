description:
  Two different byte arrays (one static, one with random values) are stored in variables by using the Identity function.
  The static array is then used as salt for a PBEParameterSpec object.

  description:
    Replace the static array that is used as salt with an array that was filled with random values
    from the SecureRandom class.

  issue-description:
    The salt that is used for the PBEParameterSpec is a small static value, which is predictable and can
    therefore lead to security issues.
