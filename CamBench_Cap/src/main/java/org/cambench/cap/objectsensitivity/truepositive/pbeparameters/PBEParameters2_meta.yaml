  Two objects are created that each contain an integer value (10 and 20000). The smaller value
  is then used as integration count for an PBEParameterSpec object.

  issue-description:
    The iteration count that is used for the PBEParameterSpec is a small value, which is not sufficient.
    Since the iteration count is meant to increase the difficulty of attacks, its value should be at least
    1000, as recommended by RFC 2898.
