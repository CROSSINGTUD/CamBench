  Static Initialization Vector Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 2

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two objects are created that each contain a byte array. One byte array is filled with random values, the other
  with static values. The static array is then used for creating an initialization vector for
  cipher initialization.

  description:
    Use the SecureRandom class to create a pseudorandom byte array instead of using a static value for iv creation.

  issue-description:
    A static value is used to create an initialization vector. This can lead to insecurities, since initialization
    vectors are often required to be random in order to guarantee a secure encryption.
