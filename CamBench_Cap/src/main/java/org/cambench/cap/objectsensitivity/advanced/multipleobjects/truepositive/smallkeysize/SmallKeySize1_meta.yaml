  Small Key Size Object-Sensitive Multiple-Objects True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  Five objects are created that each contain an integer defining a key size in bits. The object with eySize 512
  is then used to create a KeyPair for initialization of the RSA algorithm.

crypto-usage:
  violation: true

  issue-description:
    The size of the generated keys does not conform the recommended minimum of 2048 bits.
    Smaller key sizes can lead to insecurities when using the RSA algorithm.
