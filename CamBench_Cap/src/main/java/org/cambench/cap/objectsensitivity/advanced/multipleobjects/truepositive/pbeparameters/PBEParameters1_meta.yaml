description:
  Five objects are created that each contain a byte array; either filled with a static value or random values. 
  One of the static arrays is then used as salt for an PBEParameterSpec object.

  issue-description:
    The salt that is used for the PBEParameterSpec is a small static value, which is predictable and can
    therefore lead to security issues.
