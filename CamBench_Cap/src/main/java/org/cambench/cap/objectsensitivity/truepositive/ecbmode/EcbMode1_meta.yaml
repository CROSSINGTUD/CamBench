  ECB Mode Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two objects are created that each contain a configuration for the AES cipher. One with the ECB mode of operation,
  the other with GCM mode of operation. The object with the insecure ECB configuration is then utilized to
  initialize a cipher object for encryption.

fix:
  description:
    Do not utilize the ECB mode of operation. Instead, use a more secure mode, like GCM.

  issue-description:
    Block ciphers should not be used with the ECB mode of operation. ECB mode is considered to be insecure since
    identical blocks of plaintext will be encrypted to identical blocks of ciphertext.
