  Broken Crypto Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 3

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two objects are created that each hold the name of a single cipher. One contains the insecure RC2 cipher, the other
  the secure AES cipher. The object with the insecure cipher is then used to initialize a cipher object for encryption.

  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).

  issue-description:
    A cipher object is initialized based on the RC2 algorithm, which should not be utilized since brute-force
    attacks on 64-bit ciphers are possible.
