name:
  Broken Crypto Object-Sensitive Multiple-Objects True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Five objects are created that each hold the name of a single cipher. One contains a secure cipher, the other
  different insecure ciphers. 
  The object with the insecure DES cipher is then used to initialize a cipher object for encryption.

  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).

    A cipher object is initialized based on the DES algorithm, which should not be utilized as it is considered
    to be broken.
