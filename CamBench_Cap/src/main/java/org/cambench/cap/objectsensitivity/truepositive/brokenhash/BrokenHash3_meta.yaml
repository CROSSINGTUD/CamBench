name:
  Broken Hash Function Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 3

api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  Two objects are created that each hold the name of a hash algorithm. One contains the insecure MD5 algorithm, the other one
  the secure SHA-256 algorithm. The object with the insecure hash algorithm is then used
  to initialize a MessageDigest object that is used to generate the hash of some data.

    MD5 is a broken hash algorithm and should therefore not be used for its cryptographic properties.
