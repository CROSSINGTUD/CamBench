description:
  Two objects are created that each contain a byte array; one with a static value the other with random values. The static
  array is then used as salt for an PBEParameterSpec object.

    Replace the static array that is used as salt with an array that was filled with random values
    from the SecureRandom class.

    The salt that is used for the PBEParameterSpec is a small static value, which is predictable and can
    therefore lead to security issues.
