name:
  Broken Hash Function Object-Sensitive Multiple-Objects False-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  Five objects are created that each hold the name of a hash algorithm. One contains the secure SHA-256 algorithm, 
  the others different insecure algorithms. The object with the secure SHA-256 hash algorithm is then used 
  to initialize a MessageDigest object that is used to generate the hash of some data.
