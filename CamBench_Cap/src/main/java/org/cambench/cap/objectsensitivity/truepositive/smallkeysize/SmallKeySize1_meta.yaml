  Small Key Size Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  java.security.KeyPairGenerator

description:
  Two objects are created that each contain an integer defining a key size in bits (1024 and 2048). The smaller
  key size is then used to create a KeyPair for initialization of the RSA algorithm.

  description:
    Increase the key size to the recommended value of 2048 bits or more for the RSA algorithm.

  issue-description:
    The size of the generated keys does not conform the recommended minimum of 2048 bits.
    Smaller key sizes can lead to insecurities when using the RSA algorithm.
