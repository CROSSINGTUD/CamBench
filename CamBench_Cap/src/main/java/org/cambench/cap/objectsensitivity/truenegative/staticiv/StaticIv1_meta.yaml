  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  Two objects are created that each store a byte array. One array is based on a static string, 
  the other is filled with random values by using the SecureRandom class. 
  The object containing the random array is then used to create an initialization vector for cipher initialization.
