  Static Initialization Vector Object-Sensitive True-Negative Case 1

api:
  - javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two objects are created that each store a byte array. One array is based on a static string, 
  the other is filled with random values by using the SecureRandom class. 
  The object containing the random array is then used to create an initialization vector for cipher initialization.

crypto-usage:
  violation: false
  FUM:
    - argument_state

fix:
  description:
    Do not use a static string/byte array as iv. 
    Instead, use the SecureRandom class to generate a random byte array to be used as iv.
