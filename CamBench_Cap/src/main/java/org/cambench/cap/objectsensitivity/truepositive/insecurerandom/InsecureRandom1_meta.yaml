  Insecure Random Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec

description:
  Two objects are created that each contain a random generator (one of Class Random, one of class SecureRandom).
  The Random object is selected to fill a byte array with random values, which is then used to create an initialization
  vector for cipher initialization.

    Replace the used object of the "Random" class with an object of the "SecureRandom" class
    to generate a byte array for an iv.

  issue-description:
    The "Random" class is used to generate a random byte array, which can lead to insecurities.
    For cryptographic use cases, the "SecureRandom" class should be used.
