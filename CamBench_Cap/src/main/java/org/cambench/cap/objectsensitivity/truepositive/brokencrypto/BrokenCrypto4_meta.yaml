  Broken Crypto Object-Sensitive True-Positive Case 4

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  Two objects are created that each hold the name of a single cipher. One contains the insecure RC4 cipher, the other
  the secure AES cipher. The object with the insecure cipher is then used to initialize a cipher object for encryption.

  description:
    Replace the insecure cipher with a secure one (e.g. AES with an appropriate configuration).

    A cipher object is initialized based on the RC4 algorithm, which should not be utilized since it is attackable
    in several scenarios (especially SSL/TLS).
