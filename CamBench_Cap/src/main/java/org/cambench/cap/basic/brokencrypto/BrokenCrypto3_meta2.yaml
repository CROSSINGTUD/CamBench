  Broken Crypto Basic Case 3

api:
  javax.crypto.KeyGenerator

description:
  The KeyGenerator is used with an insecure algorithm (RC2).

fix:
  description:
    Replace the insecure algorithm with a secure one (e.g. AES, depending on the algorithm used for the cipher object).

  issue-description:
    The KeyGenerator is initialized with an insecure algorithm. Since insecure algorithms should not be utilized
    to create cipher objects, they also should not be utilized to create the according keys.
