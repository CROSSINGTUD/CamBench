description:
  A static, string based byte array is passed over two methods where it is then used 
  to create an initialization vector for cipher initialization.

  issue-description:
    A static value is used to create an initialization vector. This can lead to insecurities, since initialization
    vectors are often required to be random in order to guarantee a secure encryption.
