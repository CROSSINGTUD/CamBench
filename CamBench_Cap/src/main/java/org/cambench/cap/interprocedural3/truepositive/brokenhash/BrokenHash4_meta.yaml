name:
  Broken Hash Function 2-Interprocedural True-Positive Case 4

api:
  java.security.MessageDigest

description:
  A broken hash algorithm (SHA-1) is passed as value over two methods and used to initialize a MessageDigest object
  which is then utilized to compute the hash value of some data.

crypto-usage:
  violation: true
