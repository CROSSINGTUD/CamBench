name:
  ECB Mode 3-Interprocedural True-Positive Case 1

api:
  javax.crypto.Cipher

description:
  A configuration for the AES algorithm containing the ECB mode of operation is passed over two methods where a cipher
  object is then initialized with this configuration.

fix:
  description:
    Do not utilize the ECB mode of operation. Instead, use a more secure mode, like CBC.

  issue-description:
    Block ciphers should not be used with the ECB mode of operation. ECB mode is considered to be insecure since
    identical blocks of plaintext will be encrypted to identical blocks of ciphertext.
